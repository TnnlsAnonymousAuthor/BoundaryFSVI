# Function-Space Variational Inference Augmented by BoundaryGAN in Bayesian Neural Networks

This repository is an implementation of our paper **"Function-Space Variational Inference Augmented by BoundaryGAN in Bayesian Neural Networks"** in PyTorch. In this work, we propose a new function-space regularization training framework to address the context set specification problem in existing Function-space variational inference (FSVI) methods.

Existing methods mainly rely on domain knowledge to specify the context set manually. However, we find that this empirical specification could lead to unstable results and sometimes even harmful ones. Meanwhile, we observe that using only "**_boundary samples_**" around training distribution as the context set is sufficient and effective. Thus, in this work:

- (1) We propose a novel functional-space variational inference (FSVI) framework, which incorporates a context-al sample generative model into the variational learning process, utilizing the generated boundary context samples to improve the predictive performance of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs).
- (2) We propose a novel and simpler doubly evidence lower bound (dELBO) optimization objective defined across training and context data, thereby enabling more efficient variational inference to enhance the model’s OOD detection capability.
- (3) We propose a novel joint training algorithm to iteratively train the contextual generative model and optimize the dELBO objective. This enables these two components to mutually enhance each other’s performance throughout the training process.
- (4) Through extensive experiments conducted on both 2D and real-world image classification datasets, the practical effectiveness of the proposed theoretical framework is verified. This includes not only improvements in pre-diction accuracy, but also more significant enhancements in uncertainty calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities.

The overview of the proposed method is shown as following (see Section 3.1 in our paper for more details):

Our novel FSVI training framework consists of two main stages:

- **Stage (a)**: Based on a generative model boundaryGAN, boundary context samples are generated around the labeled in-distribution region.
- **Stage (b)**: By incorporating the generated context data, FSVI is used to infer the variational distribution q(θ).

## Datasets
Our work focuses on the functional-space variational inference (FSVI) methods. The effectiveness of the proposed novel framework has been empirically verified on both 2D datasets and multiple image classification datasets. Specifically, the datasets are divided into three categories: (1) Training set; (2) Context set; and (3) Out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

**2D datasets**: We illustrate the impact of different context set specifications on FSVI performance through an experiment using a synthetic 2D dataset. The dataset generation method is available in the `get_two_gaussian()` function of the [data_loader.py](data_loader.py) file, with detailed descriptions provided in Section 1 of the paper.
- The training dataset is generated by a mixture of two Gaussian distributions.
- The context sets are manually specified as points with different positional relationships to the training data.
- The OOD datasets cover all input feature space except training data region.

## Toy examples
We provide 3 quick toy demos to illustrate the motivation and effectiveness of our proposed method.

### Demo 1: Context specification problem in FSVI

The motivation of our work is that: _different context set specifications can lead to different FSVI performance  and sometimes even harmful results_.

📝 Here, we provide a 2D toy example to illustrate this, see [`examples/fsviContextSpecification.ipynb`](examples/fsviContextSpecification.ipynb) .

The detailed experiment setup can be found in Section 1 of our paper.

### Demo 2: Cost function analysis

In this work, two cost functions, our newly proposed KL divergence (Eq. (S11)) and Mahalanobis distance (Eq. (S12)), are employed for function-space regularization. Their essential objectives are the same: ensuring that the predictive function $f(\cdot;\theta)$ is close to a uniform vector $\mathcal{U}$ over the context input space.

Experimental results in Sections 4.2~4.5 support that both cost functions can effectively enhance the BNN classifier's prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration performance, and OOD detection capability. However, in some experimental settings (e.g., TinyImageNet detection task in Table 3), KL divergence cost function consistently outperforms another one.

We analyze this because Mahalanobis distance may excessively _increase or reduce the regularization strength of some context samples, which further affects the optimization process_.

📝 This script provide a calculation analysis of these two cost functions, see [`examples/costFunctionAnalysis.ipynb`](examples/costFunctionAnalysis.ipynb).

### Demo 3: Boundary sample generation

The motivation of this work is that: **_"boundary samples"_** can better facilitate FSVI (see Fig. 1). Based on this, we propose a boundaryGAN-BNN joint training framework (Algorithm S1). It uses "boundary samples", generated by boundaryGAN, to improve the BNN's prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration performance, and OOD detection ability. 

📝 As shown in the script [`examples/boundarySampleGeneration.ipynb`](examples/boundarySampleGeneration.ipynb), we now verify that the proposed approach can indeed generate such expected "boundary samples" around the training data distribution.

## Perform FSVI with empirical specified context set (Baselines)
In this work, we benchmark our proposed method against the FSVI method proposed by [Rudner et al. (2025)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RqXNXaOF6J) in two aspects:

**(1) _Context set specification:_** [Rudner et al. (2025)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RqXNXaOF6J) constructs the context sets using the three empirical strategies discussed in Appendix C.1: 

- (i) Training data augmentation.
- (ii) Specify a context set that is meaningfully distinct from the training distribution.
- (iii) Specifying a context set covering as much of the OOD input space as possible.

while our method generates them directly from the training data using boundaryGAN.

🚀 To perform FSVI with different context set, run the following command:

```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type kl_cost --ctx_dataset cifar10_augmentation --beta 1
```
```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type kl_cost --ctx_dataset eurosat --beta 1
```
```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type kl_cost --ctx_dataset cifar100_augmentation --beta 1
```

The hyperparameters are detailed as follows:
- `--dataset`: The target training dataset, choices include `cifar10` and `svhn`.
- `--cost_type`: The cost function used in Eq. (5), choices include `kl_cost` (our proposed KL divergence cost in Eq. (S11)) and `md_cost` (Mahalanobis cost in Eq. (S12)).
- `--ctx_dataset`: The context dataset to be used, choices include `svhn_augmentation`, `cifar100_augmentation`, `eurosat`, and `cifar100_augmentation`.
- `--beta`: The scaling factor $\beta$ for the cost function.

**(2) _Cost function construction:_** Our method defines a novel function-space regularization cost function as the KL divergence between predictive function and a uniform vector in Eq. (4), whereas [Rudner et al. (2025)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RqXNXaOF6J) employs their Mahalanobis distance (see Appendix A.2).

🚀 To perform FSVI with Mahalanobis distance cost function, run the following command:

```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type md_cost --ctx_dataset cifar10_augmentation --beta 0.00001
```
```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type md_cost --ctx_dataset eurosat --beta 0.00001
```
```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type md_cost --ctx_dataset cifar100_augmentation --beta 0.00001
```
```bash
python run_gan_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type md_cost --beta 0.00001
```

Here, hyperparameter `--ctx_dataset` is used to specify different empirical context dataset.

**(3) PSVI method:** We also benchmark our method against the parameter-space variational inference (PSVI) method proposed by [Blundell, et al. 2015](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/blundell15), where the optimize objective is the evidence lower bound (ELBO) defined in Eq. (1) without the context set.

🚀 To perform PSVI, run the following command:

```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --cost_type md_cost --ctx_dataset none
```

_Note: See [`run_commands.sh`](run_commands.sh) for the running commands of SVHN dataset._

**Output:** The outputs will be saved in the directory `/output/{cost_type}/{dataset}_(ctx){ctx_dataset}/`, where the BNN classifier is named as `model_epoch_20.pth`.

## Perform boundaryGAN-FSVI on customized datasets

We emphasize that the proposed method **_only requires the target training data_**, thereby using boundaryGAN to automatically generate boundary context sets without the need for manual specification.

The following three steps illustrate how to perform boundaryGAN-FSVI on customized datasets:

**Step (1): Prepare your target training dataset.**

We suggest you store datasets in a directory format with each class name as a directory, as follows (see `data/eurosat-data/` for an example):

```data/
└── your-dataname/
    ├── class1
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── class2
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

**Step (2): Load your dataset as a dataloader.**

Refer to the function `getTargetDataSet()` in the [`data_loader.py`](data_loader.py) file to load your dataset as a pytorch train/test dataloader (use `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`).

Then, add the new dataset name to to `--dataset` argument in the script [`run_gan_inference.py`](run_gan_inference.py):

```python
parser.add_argument('--dataset', default='your-dataname', help='cifar10 | svhn | your-dataname')
```

**Step (3): Run the training script.**

🚀 As before, run the following command to jointly train the boundaryGAN and BNN model on your dataset:

```bash
python run_gan_inference.py --dataset your-dataname --cost_type kl_cost --beta 1
```

This will output the trained BNN classifier and boundaryGAN model in the directory `/output/kl_cost/your-dataname_(ctx)gan/`.

**Step (4): Evaluate the trained model.**

Using the following scripts to evaluate the trained model, as described in the previous sections.

- (1) 📝 [`test_detection.py`](test_detection.py): For classification accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and OOD detection performance.

```bash
